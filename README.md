### Project Name: IndusLink
**Description:**  
IndusLink is a real-time monitoring and management application for industrial machines. It connects to industrial equipment via the OPC UA protocol, collects operational data, and organizes it using semantic technologies for in-depth analysis and visualization. The primary goals are to improve machine efficiency, enable predictive maintenance, and provide a user-friendly dashboard accessible in a desktop environment.

### Key Functional Requirements

#### 1. OPC UA Integration
- **Connection to Machines and Devices via OPC UA**: Support all OPC UA server types and device types. Use Eclipse Milo for OPC UA communication and real-time access to machine data.
- **Dynamic Device Discovery**: Implement automatic detection of new devices on the network.
- **Data Management and Parallel Connections**: Support for managing multiple simultaneous OPC UA connections.
- **Data Points and Monitoring Depth**: Collect device-specific data points, such as operational status, temperature, and energy consumption. Adjustable data update intervals for real-time monitoring.

#### 2. Semantic Modeling with Ontologies
- **Data Organization and Contextualization**: Use Apache Jena for RDF data processing and the OWL API for ontology management, integrating industrial standards like SSN and RDF.
- **Flexible Ontology Model**: Support various machine types and configurations with a flexible ontology model.
- **SPARQL Queries**: Provide a powerful querying interface to support knowledge-based decisions through SPARQL queries.

#### 3. Real-Time Monitoring and Dashboard
- **Dashboard Design**: Implement a Vaadin frontend to display real-time machine data, status indicators, historical data, and KPIs.
- **Visualizations**: Provide timeline graphs, line and bar charts for historical data, and optionally heat maps for detailed data analysis.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Dynamic thresholds, pop-up notifications for critical events. Configurable alert and notification mechanisms for operators to respond quickly.
- **Customizable UI**: Allow users to customize widgets and dashboard structure according to their requirements.

#### 4. Predictive Maintenance and Analytics
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze real-time and historical data to detect patterns indicating maintenance needs.
- **KPI Measurement and Analysis**: Provide KPIs such as OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness), MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures), and MT2R (Mean Time to Repair).
- **Machine Learning-Based Maintenance Prediction**: Integrate basic machine learning models to enhance predictive maintenance capabilities.

#### 5. User Roles and Access Security
- **User Roles**: Support user roles such as "User" and "Admin" with specific access rights for each.
- **Authentication and Access Control**: Local authentication and authorization, potentially expandable to external identity services like LDAP.

### Technical Requirements

#### Platform
- **Java-Based Web Application**: Spring Boot for a local embedded server setup, allowing easy deployment and use on desktops.

#### Frontend UI
- **Vaadin Flow**: A fully Java-based, reactive UI framework for real-time display and control.

#### Backend Components
- **OPC UA**: Eclipse Milo for connectivity and data retrieval from OPC UA-enabled devices.
- **Semantic Technologies**: Apache Jena and OWL API for data modeling and ontology management.
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL for relational data and InfluxDB for time-series data storage and analysis.
- **Event Streaming with Kafka**: Apache Kafka for messaging and event streaming, enabling large-scale data processing and support for scalable real-time analytics.

#### Embedded Server
- **Server**: Embedded Tomcat server with Spring Boot to allow local execution with a web interface without requiring an external setup.

#### Dependency and Build Management
- **Maven**: Manage project dependencies to ensure all necessary libraries and tools are available.

#### Testing
- **JUnit 5**: Conduct unit and integration testing to validate the functionality of each component.
- **Vaadin Testbench (optional)**: UI testing and end-to-end automation for frontend components.

### Project Architecture

#### Frontend (UI Layer)
- **Vaadin Flow Components**: Build interactive views, forms, and charts to visualize machine statuses and data.
- **Main View (MainView)**: Display machine statuses, alerts, and data visualizations.

#### Backend (Business Logic Layer)
- **OPC UA Integration**: Implement Eclipse Milo for connectivity and data retrieval from industrial machines.
- **Ontology Service**: Use Apache Jena and the OWL API to model and store machine relationships and maintenance schedules.
- **Event Streaming**: Integrate Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming and distribution to support scalability and advanced analytics capabilities.

#### Persistence Layer
- **PostgreSQL and InfluxDB**: Store historical machine data, user preferences, and other persistent data.

#### OPC UA Layer
- **Independent Management of OPC UA Connections**: Manage multiple connections to OPC UA servers to capture and provide machine data.

### Additional Considerations

#### Data Persistence and Archiving
- **Data Retention**: Long-term storage of historical data in PostgreSQL/InfluxDB, including archiving and retention policies.
- **Data Management**: Provide functionality to manage and purge older data.

#### Offline Mode and Data Synchronization
- **Offline Mode**: The application should be able to function without a network connection. Once the connection is restored, data synchronization will occur.

#### Extensibility and External Interfaces
- **External APIs**: Provide APIs to allow external systems to retrieve or add data.
- **Modular Architecture**: Implement a modular architecture to support future extensions, such as additional device types and data sources.

#### Security
- **Data Protection and Validation**: Implement data security with validation, error handling, and optional authentication to protect sensitive industrial data.

#### Scalability
- **Local Application with Scalability Potential**: Spring Boot and PostgreSQL provide the option to scale for multiple users and larger data sets.
