### Project Name: IndusLink
**Description:**  
IndusLink is a real-time monitoring and management application for industrial machines. It connects to industrial equipment via the OPC UA protocol, gathers operational data, and organizes it using semantic technologies for in-depth analysis and visualization. The primary goals are to improve machine efficiency, enable predictive maintenance, and provide a user-friendly dashboard accessible in a desktop environment.

### Key Functional Requirements

#### 1. OPC UA Integration
- **Connection to Machines and Devices via OPC UA**: Use Eclipse Milo for OPC UA communication to retrieve machine data in real-time.
- **Data Collection**: Capture and store critical data points such as operational status, temperature, and energy consumption.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Provide live data monitoring for immediate feedback on machine conditions.

#### 2. Semantic Modeling with Ontologies
- **Data Organization and Contextualization**: Use Apache Jena for RDF data processing and the OWL API for ontology management.
- **Create an OWL Ontology**: Represent machines, maintenance schedules, and data relationships, enabling advanced queries through SPARQL.
- **SPARQL Queries**: Provide a powerful data querying interface to support knowledge-based decision-making.

#### 3. Real-Time Monitoring and Dashboard
- **Dashboard Design**: Implement a Vaadin frontend to display real-time machine data, including status indicators, historical data, and KPIs.
- **Alert Functionality**: Show alerts and critical information for operators to react quickly.
- **Main and Detailed Views**: Provide an overview as well as detailed views for individual machines and data points.

#### 4. Predictive Maintenance and Analytics
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze historical and real-time data to identify patterns indicating maintenance needs.
- **Maintenance Suggestions and Alerts**: Display preventive maintenance recommendations to avoid unexpected downtimes.
- **Future Enhancement**: Integrate simple analytics or machine learning models to improve predictive maintenance capabilities.

### Technical Requirements

#### Platform
- **Java-Based Web Application**: Spring Boot for a local embedded server setup, allowing easy deployment and use on desktops.

#### Frontend UI
- **Vaadin Flow**: A fully Java-based, reactive UI framework for real-time display and control.

#### Backend Components
- **OPC UA**: Eclipse Milo to connect to and collect data from OPC UA-enabled devices.
- **Semantic Technologies**: Apache Jena and OWL API for data modeling and ontology management.
- **Database**: Option between H2 (lightweight, embedded) and PostgreSQL (scalable for distributed applications).

#### Embedded Server
- **Server**: Embedded Tomcat server (instead of Jetty) with Spring Boot to allow local execution with a web interface without external server setup.

#### Dependency and Build Management
- **Maven**: Manages project dependencies to ensure all necessary libraries and tools are available.

#### Testing
- **JUnit 5**: Conduct unit and integration testing to validate functionality of each component.
- **Vaadin Testbench (optional)**: UI testing and end-to-end automation for frontend components.

### Project Architecture

#### Frontend (UI Layer)
- **Vaadin Flow Components**: Build interactive views, forms, and charts to visualize machine statuses and data.
- **Main View (MainView)**: Displays machine statuses, alerts, and data visualizations.

#### Backend (Business Logic Layer)
- **OPC UA Integration**: Implement Eclipse Milo for connectivity and data retrieval from industrial machines.
- **Ontology Service**: Use Apache Jena and the OWL API for modeling and storing machine relationships and maintenance schedules.

#### Persistence Layer
- **H2 or PostgreSQL Database**: Store historical machine data, user preferences, and other persistent data.

#### OPC UA Layer
- **Independent Management of OPC UA Connections**: Connect to OPC UA servers, capture data, and feed it into the application.

### Additional Considerations

#### Scalability
- **Local Application with Scalability Potential**: Spring Boot and PostgreSQL provide the option to scale for multiple users or larger data sets in the future.

#### Security
- **Data Protection and Validation**: Implement data validation, error handling, and optional authentication to protect sensitive industrial data.

#### Extensibility
- **Modular and Extensible Design**: Designed to allow new features (e.g., advanced analytics, additional machine integrations) to be added without impacting existing functionality.
